# AtliQ Grands Revenue Maximization Dashboard

## Situation
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry, has witnessed a decline in market share and revenue due to strategic competition and management decisions. In response, the managing director initiated a strategic move to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to reclaim their market position.

## Task
The objective is to create a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI that facilitates informed decision-making to maximize revenue.

## Action
To achieve this, a Power BI dashboard has been developed, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and dynamic filters for a holistic understanding of the business.

### KPIs
1. **Revenue:** Total revenue realized.
2. **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room):** Measures revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not, for accurate pricing and benchmarking.
3. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Average number of rooms ready to sell per day within a specified time period.
4. **Occupancy%:** Percentage of successful bookings to total room capacity.
5. **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Ratio of revenue to total rooms booked or sold, representing the average paid for rooms sold.
6. **Realization%:** Percentage of successful "checked out" bookings over total bookings.

### Features
- Week over week changes displayed for each KPI.
- Tooltips incorporated for enhanced data insights.
- Dynamic filters available for City, Room Class, Months, and Weeks.

## Insights
1. **Donut Chart:** Reveals that 38% of revenue comes from the business category, while the remainder is from the luxury category.
2. **Trend by Key Matrix Graph:** Illustrates trends in RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy%.
3. **Weekdays and Weekend Table:** Provides insights into RevPAR, Occupancy%, ADR, and Realization% for weekdays and weekends.
4. **Online Booking Platform and Property Key Matrix:** Final insights to inform strategic decisions.

## Result
- Improving pricing strategy, such as adopting weekday-weekend pricing or dynamic pricing, could significantly increase revenue.
- Strategic promotion of services and business is identified as a key factor in revenue enhancement.
